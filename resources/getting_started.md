So, you want to be a developer?
===============================

But you aren't sure where to start?  This guide may help!


Getting Started
---------------

* Find a mentor: or two! in person or online, they can help you customize your learning to you, answer questions you may have, and help you out when you get stuck
* Make your own code: Get a Github account, and post your projects or code samples online (Github is a code repository website using Gti, which is a version control system, that allows history, revisions, and coding together with others)
* Look at other's code: you can look at code repos on Github (or elsewhere online, like a cool website), and figure out how the code or website works
* Use the force (ie, the internet): there are many resources for helping you get started and keep you going. Pick a topic, and find everything you can on it!
* Learn how you learn: and never stop learning, always reach outside your comfort zone.
* Feel the Struggle: It helps you to remember what you have learned
* Fail, fast and often: I know, it's a buzzword lately, but you really do learn a lot by trying out new things, or new ways of doing old things, and sometimes failing at them!  You won't know if you don't try!


What language should I learn?
-----------------------------

Pick any language that interests you to get started.  If you are interested and excited about a particular language, you will be more likely to keep at your learning.  And each languages has it's pros and cons; just getting started is the important part. Each language also has it's own syntax, but the difference is usually the naming of things, the uses of the syntax are quite often very similar.

Here are a few recommendations, if you really have no idea what to try out.

### General purpose ###
* Python (https://www.python.org/) - is a complied language; many people really love the ease of use and straightforwardness of Python, so I recommend it as a good starting language.  Python is used at the command line, but it is pretty easy to get started with.


### Frontend ###
* Javascript (https://www.javascript.com/) - is an interpreted language and if you are doing any kind of frontend development, likely Javascript is involved.  Also, the bar to entry is low, you just need a plain text editor and a browser.
* HTML (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) - essential for frontend work, HTML is the part of the UI in the browser that gives web pages their structure
* CSS (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics) - essential for frontend work, CSS is the part of the UI in the browser that gives web pages their styling, color, size, font, etc.


### Backend ###
* PHP (https://secure.php.net/) - is an interpreted language that has grown up with the web, and the newest version, PHP7, is much more solid than older versions.  The nice thing about PHP is it is not compiled, so it has a low bar to entry (like Javascript.) Also, much of the web is using PHP, so having some experience with PHP may help you get work later on.
* Java (https://www.java.com/en/) - is a compiled language that is cross platform, it takes a little more to get setup with Java.  But due to it being cross platform, it is a good choice for development on the web
* C# (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) - is a compiled language, and is currently a Microsoft only language. C# is used with Microsoft's .NET platform (although they are planning to release a Mac version, so we will see where this goes)
* C++ (http://www.cplusplus.com/info/description/) - is a compiled language used often in software and application development, and allows lower level access to the computer.

Also, you may want to read up on Compiled versus Interpreted languages, to have a good understanding of what those terms mean.

Basic programming concepts
--------------------------

Most of the very basic programming concepts are available in any modern language, and you can transfer this base knowledge to other languages.

* Loops
* Control structures
* Variables
* Data types
* Functions


Architecture and Design
-----------------------

Stepping it up a notch!  Once you have the basics covered, you may want to do some studying into these topics

* Modularity
* Naming things
* Object Orientated programming
* Functional programming


Computer science concepts
-------------------------
* Pointers
* Recursion
* Arrays, linked lists, hashtables
* Sorts
* File I/O
* Database concepts (CRUD operations)
* Binary numbers
* Algorithms and design patterns
* Data structures
* Iterators/generators


UX/UI concepts
--------------
User Experience and User Interface

* Usability
* User experience
* Interface Design
* Accessibility


Testing
-------
Definitely an important topic, testing helps you define your software, and allow you to do things more easily, like adding features or refactoring

* TDD (Test Driven Development)
  * https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/tdd/
* Unit tests
* End to end testing
* UI testing
