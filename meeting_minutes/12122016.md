    * Danielle Closs
    * Matt Morgan

Tasks:
* Attempt to document tasks for roles, so we have a shared knowledgebase for anyone to pitch in and help with roles as needed (at minimum, gather up what Brian has been posting in gitter)
* create a meeting minutes folder, and add meeting notes from this meeting - Danielle
* Update the study group time commitment and tasks
* Update financial director with possible tasks and responsibilities, also what benefits we would have (non profit status, less out of pocket for leadership team, etc.) - Danielle
* Make a list of things sponsors could pay for directly (website, domain, etc.)
* Miguel mentioned getting together some speaking resources and posting them

Problems/Issues to think about:
* How to get “new blood” (new members)

Ideas:
* Maybe get paid speakers? Possibly have sponsors pay for speakers?
* Ian mentioned a mini CRM for keeping track of speakers (could we use a google site with contacts for this?)
* Maddy mentioned a newsletter, to keep open the communication between members and sponsors; what kinds of things would we want to have in the newsletter? (maybe use mailchimp?)

Notes:
* For new speakers, they just need lots of encouragement...  bounce ideas off of us over lunch
