Goals of Study Group:
* The agenda itself is the idea of what the study core idea is... basically make sure everyone is participating in a learning/teaching activity and really, really, really make sure everyone feels like they can and should participate
* Bring together the brilliant minds of the tech industry within Ann Arbor, to be accessible to those who want to learn from them

Ideas for future study groups meetings:
* Live coding walk through 
* 1/27/2017-
	* Randoori style pair programming
	* Dot voting for topics
	* Present list of topic ideas?
	* Have giveaways for involved participants? (we were talking about seeing who could get through the most code kadas, and maybe giving away a tshirt once in a while…)
* How do we continue to making people feel welcome and give them help and resources, during and in between meetings?
* The new group project Miguel mentioned at the last study group (He said that Brian and he were cooking up something new.  I am wanting more details about this!  I think it's a good idea, the last project I think was too complicated for newbies)

Before the study group:
* Mention food in Meetup online before the Meetup, so people know there is food available (a lot of people did not eat last time around)
* Use twitter to remind people of the meetup before the meetup
* Maybe also have a whiteboard ready (ask Dave before the meeting starts)
* Might also be useful to touch base with Dave briefly prior to the meeting, in case he has something he needs to talk about before members arrive

At the study group meeting:
* Bug Dan (or one of our other regulars) before the study group and ask what topics they may talk about, and mention this at the beginning of the study group
* Introduce Dave and Pillar
* Let people know that there is food available (if Dave doesn't mention it)
* Mention our projects (group project, exercism.io, etc.)
* Mention the study group chat room in gitter.im
* Try to get experienced devs mingling more with those with less experience (I saw a major split between those with more experience and those with less experience at the last group)
* Delegate helping newer devs to other experienced devs if needed (I felt like I was handling multiple newer devs last time, not sure how well I was doing!)
* Remind people there is food again about half way through (this seemed to help get people up and moving, getting a break, and got a little more of the food eaten)
* Remind people when we are almost out of time, so they can finish up what they are doing and be ready to leave at 8
* Help Pillar keep things clean by helping clean up at the end of the study group
* 1/27/2017 -
	* be the liaison/facilitator, not the teacher, pass new devs off to other experienced devs
	* The main goal is to remove the intimidation
	* Make sure the people that seem shy and new get more of the attention, and get the attention first
	* Work the room :)
	* Me and matt should both be "working the room"
	* Get a third person to run the group project (who would do this that is usually at study group?)

After the study group meeting:
* Maybe we should be thanking everyone for coming on the meetup website? Or in gitter.im?
* Continue trying to help the members in between meetings, usually through gitter.im or emails…
