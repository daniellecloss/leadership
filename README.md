## Documents we need to create:
- Vision
- 5 year plan
- Costs of doing business

## Current director roles we need to define:
- High Level Delegator [ BTW the name of this role seems a little strange, I think maybe we should brainstorm a new name, vision director maybe? :) ] - this role involves defining the future vision for the meetup group, is the final say on most decisions regarding direction and high level planning, and helps direct and answer questions for others in their roles; this role also can seek out new leadership members or define new roles as needed; this role would produce at least the first draft of the vision and 5 year plan  (all of these activities/decisions will be made in conjunction with the rest of the leadership team)
- Sponsorship Director - this role is responsible for finding companies (or other groups) to sponsor our meetup meetings in various forms, such as monetary, venue, food, swag, etc. This role also maintains these sponsorship relationships, to support the funding of the meetup group (works closely with the venue director, and other roles involved with securing sponsorships)
- Venue Director - this role is responsible for securing (and communicating with) a sponsor for the venue for each meetup meeting, and making sure that this venue has the appropriate ammenites (projector, space, chairs/tables, etc.); currently this role also finds/communicates with a food sponsor for each meeting as well
- Jobs Director - this role involves connecting members of our meetup group that are seeking jobs with sponsor companies (or other companies with which we have ties)
- Programs Director - This role involves maintaining high-level support for current programs (talks, study group.) This role also seeks out and finds people that are able and willing to speak/present at the meetups, and run these programs.  This role also brainstorms future project/activity/program possibilities, as well as discusses/communicates these new ideas with the rest of the leadership team; this role also should enable these programs to happen, whether it be by making a plan and directing the program themselves, or finding someone who is willing and able to make the program happen
- AV Director - this role involves recording meetup talks, editing/compiling videos, and posting these videos to the meetup youtube channel (also currently supplying the video/computer equipment to do so)
- Communications Director - this role involves internal (for group members) and external (meetup group "image") communication and materials (marketing, social media, logo, swag/sticker designs, etc.)
- Study Group Director - this role involves maintaining the study group meeting for this meetup group; this involves making attendees feel welcome at the study group, answer questions, give them help or resources as needed, directing discussion, and possibly leading the way for the study group project that is currently underway.  This role could also involves brainstorming future project/activity possibilities; this role currently also secures food/venue for the study group meeting

## Notes/Questions:
- How much detail is needed for each of these "role descriptions" to make sure that each person completing a role has enough information to do the job?
- In the future, it would be nice to have backups or additional coverage for each role (listed here)
- In the future, it would be nice to have a ballpark of how much time would be needed for each role
- Is the food sponsorship included in the Venue director or included in the Sponsorship Director role?  These roles seem to not be split as I have seen them presented in the semjs slides in the past (separate sponsorships for venue, food, av, and swag)
- As corny as it may sound, I also thought maybe we should rename these roles to be more unique to our meetup (kind of like how atomic object calls their employees atoms...)  Just throwing that out there!
- If we do go down the road of analyzing the cost of doing business, we really should make a role that deals with finances, even if it is part of another role (maybe the sponsorship director, as they will have the 'money coming in' part of the equation...)
- If the programs director role is defnining new programs, that role is probably too big to encompass both finding new speakers for the meetup meetings and brainstorming and defining new programs and kicking them off...  we may want to split it up then
- Everyone please review this and update as needed, I am really just throwing this out there, so we have a starting place, not trying to define the roles myself!  I think we will also be discussing this at our leadership meeting, we could review then as well...
